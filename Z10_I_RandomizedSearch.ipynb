    "Na przykładzie modelu *XGBoost* widzimy, że niektóre algorytmy są wysoce parametryzowalne, i prawidłowy dobór hiperparametrów potrafi czasami istotnie podnieść jakość naszych predykcji.  \n",
    "Poznaliśmy już przeszukiwanie po ustalonej siatce parametrów - `GridSearchCV`. Metoda ta ma jednak dwie dość istotne wady:\n",
    "* rozmiar siatki bardzo szybko rośnie wraz z ilością parametrów. Już dla czterech parametrów, po 5 wartości każdy, dostajemy $5^4 = 625$ kombinacji. W sytuacji, kiedy model uczy nam się minutę (a to w praktyce bardzo optymisyczny przypadek) musimy czekać 10 godzin na przejście pętli.\n",
    "* niska gęstość siatki powoduje, że możemy nie wstrzelić się w tą optymalną wartość. Przykład:\n",
